- Clearly describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you propose.
- Once done, submit the issue.

### 2. Assign the Issue to Yourself
- After creating the issue, assign it to yourself to let others know you're working on it.
- You can do this by clicking on the **Assignees** section on the right-hand side and selecting your username.

### 3. Open a Branch from the Issue
- Create a new branch in your local repository. The branch name should be descriptive and related to the issue.

  ```
  git fetch origin
  git checkout -b [branch-name]
  ```

### 4. Implement Your Changes

- Once changes are complete, commit them to your branch.

### 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Push your branch to the remote repository.
- Go to the **Pull Requests** tab in the GitHub repository and click **New Pull Request**.
- Compare your branch with the main branch and create the pull request.
- Ensure you provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR description.

### 6. Request a Review
- After opening a PR, request a review from a team member other than yourself.
- To do this, select a reviewer in the **Reviewers** section on the right-hand side of the PR page.

### 7. Merge into Main (after Approval)
- Once your PR is reviewed and approved, you can merge your changes into the main branch.
